// This is a `for loop`.
// This is used to run a portion of code multiple times.
// In this case, we want to run some code 10 times.
// To do this, we tell the loop to begin at index 0
// and run until the index is 10. 
// In particular, the code being ran 10x is lines 8-43.
//
// Why use a `for loop`?
// We could copy and paste the same code over and over...and over...and over.
// This isn't sustainable in cases where we need to repeat a task many times.
// Plus, we could make a mistake copying and pasting...we've all done it right?
